Define polymorphism in how it relates to Computer Science and give an example.



Polymorphsim is an object oriented programming concept. Simply put, it means a variable,
object or function can take on multiple forms. 

The simplest explanation that I read to explain polymorphism is this:

There is a base class named Animals, which has the subclasses Horse, Fish and Bird.

The Animals class has a function named Move that the subclasses inherit.

Polymorphism means that each subclass has its own way of implementing the function.....
When the Move function is called on a Horse object, the function may respond by displaying trotting 
on the screen. When Move is called on a Fish object it may respond by displaying swimming on the 
screen. And when Move is called on a Bird object, it may display flying on the screen.
